<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teen pregnancy is a widespread occurrence with well-established causes and negative effects on a person's health, society, and economy. The adolescent birth rate has declined globally, albeit at varying rates in different geographic areas. Significant differences in levels exist both across and within nations. Pregnancy among teenagers is more common among people with less education or lower socioeconomic level. Additionally, among these and other disadvantaged populations, there is less success in lowering adolescent first births, which results in growing inequality. Girls are more likely to become pregnant, frequently unintentionally, as a result of child marriage and child sexual abuse. Adolescents are frequently unable to use or access contraceptives, which makes it difficult for them to avoid unwanted pregnancy. Access to high-quality maternal care for teenagers who are pregnant and parenting is gaining more and more attention. WHO collaborates with partners to promote awareness of teenage pregnancy, provide an evidence foundation for action, develop tools to support policies and programs, build capacity, and assist nations in successfully addressing adolescent pregnancy.
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have just ten years left to be completed, and political challenges from the highest levels of the UN system and member states require quick action. While time is running out for everyone, certain groups are being left behind more than others. The COVID-19 pandemic has once again shown that the focus of such acceleration must be on those who are most left behind. Scaling up and maintaining effective health interventions is required, along with improvements in underlying social, economic, and environmental conditions, or the social and structural determinants of health. Teenagers are included in this. Teenagers continue to be an underserved demographic while making up a growing share of the populations in low- and middle-income countries. But when they reach adulthood, they lay a crucial basis for healthy behavior as well as for social and productive citizenship for years to come, helping to create a sustainable future. 
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare systems that are underfunded may collapse under the weight of expanding populations. High rates of unintended pregnancies and avoidable maternal fatalities are caused by a lack of access to high-quality reproductive healthcare, which includes contemporary contraception and medically safe abortion. Over 800 women die every day from pregnancy-related problems worldwide, where roughly half of all pregnancies are still unwanted. The total number of women who still need contraception is rising as a result of population expansion. Particularly in locations where health facilities are already stretched thin, extremely high population densities encourage the spread of illness and are detrimental to public health. Investments in universal access to high-quality health care, including family planning services, assist to control population growth and enhance quality of life.
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those fresh mothers, networking and mentorship opportunities may be beneficial. Comprehensive sex education that covers topics like contraception and healthy relationships is crucial for programs aimed at preventing teen pregnancy. To give access to reproductive health treatments, you might also wish to think about forming a partnership with healthcare providers. The goal of this project is to encourage more teenagers toIt specifically attempted to pinpoint implementation issues and determine what kind of shared strategy might be suggested to improve the ENGP policy. To support adolescent moms with skill-development initiatives, teen pregnancy prevention initiatives, and mobile apps that may be used offline.

<h1>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</h1>  
  
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this study is to comprehend how student moms manage their circumstances in relation to their academics and childrearing. What difficulties, precisely, have they had in balancing their studies with caring for their children at home. The study also aims to identify the coping mechanisms employed by student mothers in these situations. With this in mind, the study's goal is to aid readers in understanding the challenges faced by student moms.The Philippines has one of the highest adolescent birth rates among the ASEAN Member States. Recent World Bank data shows that the Philippines has 47 births annually per 1,000 women aged 15-19, higher than the average adolescent birth rates of 44 globally and 33.5 in the ASEAN region.

<h1> SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT </h1>  
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Student Mothers. They could gain insight about their situation and be aware of their responsibilities as both parent and student. This will help to analyzing data including academic performance, financial support, and childcare arrangements, we can better understand the barriers that student mothers face and identify strategies to support them. 
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Students. They will gain deeper understanding about the reality of student mothers and most importantly for them to learn about the experiences of student mothers. To provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to this issue and inform the development of effective prevention strategies. By analyzing data including age, race, socioeconomic status, and geographic location, we can better understand the risk factors associated with teenage pregnancy and identify targeted interventions.
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future researchers. May be better equipped to comprehend the issue of adolescent pregnancy by utilizing the data and analysis provided in this study, which was developed by the proponents. They can follow the project's lead and get the data they need for a thorough investigation. This might provide them with a general overview of the issue of how the Philippines is addressing the growing number of pregnancies among adolescents.

<h1>METHODS</h1>  
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers will use available datasets from Our World in Data to analyze the number of pregnancies among adolescents in the Philippines. Categories such as month, year, region, and number of teen pregnancies will be available. All members have access to the original data sources and extraction tables. And other country to have a comparison the level of pregnant people in every month and year.   
       Another way is to estimate the adolescent fertility rate using official statistics on live births, deaths, and population by age group. This method may be less precise than the survey-based method, especially if births are underreported or there are disparities in the population's age distribution.
Whatever method is utilized, it is critical to verify that the data is as precise and thorough as possible, as well as to evaluate any potential biases or restrictions in the data.

<h1>EXPECTED OUTPUT</h1>  
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project aims to developed to be appealing to teenagers and their carers, as well as youth-serving organizations and health care practitioners who may advocate its use in their services.Adolescent fertility has been a recurring issue in the Philippines due to the high number of teenage pregnancies and births. According to some research, the rate will rise even more in the future, however particular forecasts may vary based on factors such as access to family planning, educational achievement, and work opportunities. When a teenager gives birth, her and her child's health and well-being are put at risk, which can have long-term social and economic consequences for families and communities. The Philippine government and other organizations are tackling adolescent fertility by increasing access to contraception and encouraging sexual health education.The government can strive to reduce teenage fertility rates in the Philippines by addressing the root causes of adolescent fertility, such as poverty and illiteracy.The expected output of the teenage fertility rate in the Philippines differs depending on the research or report. According to the data, adolescent fertility in the Philippines has been high, and the rate is expected to rise in the future, according to some study. There are, however, initiatives underway to address and minimize adolescent fertility through sexual and reproductive health policies and treatments.It is important to remember that the present situation and plans for the future are vulnerable to change from a variety of circumstances and should be viewed with care. Furthermore, for exact information on teenage fertility rates in the Philippines, official sources such as the World Bank or United Nations data portals are recommended.
